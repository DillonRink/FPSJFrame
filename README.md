**FPSJFrame Project:**

This FPS game combines basic 2D game mechanics with ray-casting to create a 3D-like effect, allowing the player to navigate through a maze.
The game includes audio integration, providing background music while the player explores the map. 
The game uses keyboard inputs for movement and transitions between different states (startup, in-game, and congratulatory messages). 
Audio stops playing once the player completes the game.

**Running of the Project:**
